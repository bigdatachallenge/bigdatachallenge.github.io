With excruciatingly long commutes to school, an inundation of homework, and his crippling fear of productivity, he decided to join his friends and start making short films. Other ways in which he attempts to assuage his cortisol are through martial arts, computer programming and, of course, video games. Josh is concerned with the mental health of youth, and is seeking ways to mend this problem in both his school and the community. As this is his first year with Ward 6, Josh is super stoked to meet you!">
